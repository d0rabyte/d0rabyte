# 👋 Hi, I'm Dora — exploring my path into IT & technology

I'm at the very beginning of my IT journey.  I don’t always know what I’m doing yet — but I enjoy exploring, learning, and figuring things out step by step! 😄
After working many years in finance, I’m now slowly rebuilding my foundations in tech — learning step by step, at my own pace, while balancing life changes, studying, and finding my direction.

Right now, I'm exploring:
- IT fundamentals (CompTIA ITF+)
- Python basics
- How computers, networks, and systems work
- Introductory cybersecurity concepts
- AI and how technology can make life easier for people

My learning has had pauses and restarts, but I'm determined to keep going.

## 🌼 What I’m currently doing
- Rebuilding my study routine  
- Taking small steps in Python  
- Organising my IT notes  
- Learning Git & GitHub basics  
- Trying out different areas of IT to see what fits me best  

I don’t rush — I focus on understanding, not racing.

## 🧰 Tools I'm becoming familiar with
- Python  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git & GitHub  
- Excel (advanced formulas from my finance background)  
- Windows OS basics  
- Markdown for notes

## 📘 My GitHub will include:
- Simple Python practice files  
- IT learning notes  
- Little experiments  
- My study roadmap  
- Anything I create as I grow in tech  

Nothing big — just honest progress.

## 🎯 My long-term goals
- Build a solid IT foundation  
- Progress to CompTIA A+ and Network+  
- Find my place in IT (support, cybersecurity, or data)  
- Keep learning and improving, one small step at a time

## ✨ About Me
I'm curious, organised, and love learning new things.  
Technology always gives me something new to explore — and I’m excited to grow, even if slowly.
